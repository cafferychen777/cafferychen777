# Hello! I'm Caffery Yang👋

I am a rising senior at **Southern Medical University**, majoring in Biostatistics. With an impressive **3.95/4.00 GPA**, I stand among the top 2% of my class.

## 🎖 Achievements
- Received the [**National Scholarship**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yry7uzQGdY1d56VRJJo3cqil1jeTWXL6BipN1oNld-Y/edit) from the Ministry of Education of China.
- Secured **First Prize** in the National College Student Mathematics Competition.
- Honored with **Meritorious Winner (M Award)** in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) in the USA.

## 🧪 Research Interests
Under the guidance of [**Prof. Jun Chen**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gonDvdwAAAAJ&hl=en) at Mayo Clinic and [**Prof. Liangliang Zhang**](https://sites.google.com/view/lyonszhang/home?authuser=0) at Case Western Reserve University, my research primarily revolves around microbiome data analysis.

- Developed the [**MicrobiomeStat R package**](https://www.microbiomestat.wiki/), penning **over 15,000 lines of R code** and an extensive wiki documentation exceeding **20,000 words**.
- Pioneered the [**MicrobiomeGallery**](https://a95dps-caffery-chen.shinyapps.io/MicrobiomeGallery/) collaborative platform.
- Independently developed the [**ggpicrust2**](https://github.com/cafferychen777/ggpicrust2) R package, which amassed **48 stars** on GitHub and **over 5,000 downloads** on CRAN.

My future vision embraces a **multi-omics perspective**, synthesizing insights from **genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics**, and more.

## 📚 Publications
- Sole first author on a paper accepted by **Bioinformatics**.

## 🤝 Collaboration
I am **extremely open to collaborations**. If you have any projects related to microbiomics or multi-omics and think we could work together, please don't hesitate to reach out. Additionally, if any of my ongoing projects resonate with your interests, I warmly invite you to collaborate. Feel free to contact me!

## 🎯 Looking Forward
As I transition into my final undergraduate year, I am fervently seeking **PhD programs** in Biostatistics, Computational Biology, or associated domains for Fall 2024. I invite potential collaborators or advisors to connect!

## 🛠 Projects

#### 1. Application of LLM in Microbiome Taxonomy
Claude's innovative approach using the entire NCBI database with the LLM offers direct taxonomic insights from FASTQ sequences. A potential game-changer when compared with traditional methods.

#### 2. Performance of Microbiome DA Methods in Other Omics
Exploring how microbiome DA methods, known for processing the compositional nature of microbiome data, perform on other omics.

#### 3. Generative AI in Microbiome Data Analysis and Accuracy Assessment
Assessing the LLM model's capability as a microbiome data analysis expert against real-world experts.

#### 4. PI_find
A tool designed to assist graduate school aspirants in discovering PI names from specific professional journals.

#### 5. Fine-Tuning Platform for Bioinformatics Repositories
Aiming to develop a platform to fine-tune ChatGPT with bioinformatics repositories, enhancing query results for newer tools.
