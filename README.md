üìä Statistics PhD Student | üß¨ Multi-Omics Analyst | üñ• R Package Developer

## Hello! I'm Caffery Yangüëã

I am thrilled to be joining the Statistics PhD program at Texas A&M University in Fall 2024. 

## üéñ Achievements
- Awarded the **Inaugural Su Binghua Distinguished Biostatistics Scholarship** ($2,800) by Tigermed, 2024
  - Only undergraduate recipient among PhD candidates across mainland China
- Received the **National Scholarship** from the Ministry of Education of China.
- Secured **First Prize** in the National College Student Mathematics Competition.
- Honored with **Meritorious Winner (M Award)** in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) in the USA.

## üß™ Research Interests
Under the guidance of [**Prof. Jun Chen**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gonDvdwAAAAJ&hl=en) at Mayo Clinic and [**Prof. Liangliang Zhang**](https://sites.google.com/view/lyonszhang/home?authuser=0) at Case Western Reserve University, my research primarily revolves around microbiome data analysis.

- Developed the [**MicrobiomeStat R package**](https://github.com/cafferychen777/MicrobiomeStat), writing **over 17,000 lines of R code**. Comprehensive documentation is available on the [**package wiki**](https://www.microbiomestat.wiki/), which contains in-depth guidance and tutorials exceeding **20,000 words**. Additionally, an interactive [**MicrobiomeStat Shiny application**](https://microbiomestat.shinyapps.io/MicrobiomeStat-Shiny/) has been created to provide a user-friendly platform for longitudinal statistical analysis and visualization of microbiome data.
- Pioneered the [**MicrobiomeGallery**](https://a95dps-caffery-chen.shinyapps.io/MicrobiomeGallery/) collaborative platform.
- Independently developed the [**ggpicrust2**](https://github.com/cafferychen777/ggpicrust2) R package, which amassed **85 stars** on GitHub and **over 11,000 downloads** on CRAN.

My future vision embraces a **multi-omics perspective**, synthesizing insights from **genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics**, and more.

## üìö Publications
- Sole first author on a paper accepted by **Bioinformatics**.
- Preparing to submit another paper as sole first author to **Microbiome**.

## ü§ù Collaboration
I am **very open to collaborations**, especially in the areas of microbiomics, multi-omics, single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, and microbiome data analysis. If you have any projects in these fields and believe we could collaborate, please don't hesitate to reach out. Along with being open to new opportunities, I am particularly eager to assist others with their data analysis needs in these areas. I am also keen to work with researchers who have utilized my pipelines, such as **ggpicrust2** or **MicrobiomeStat**, in their studies. If you're considering using or have already incorporated these tools into your research, I'd love to explore potential co-authorship opportunities. Whether it's contributing to data analysis, interpretation, or manuscript preparation, I am ready to lend my expertise to your research. Let‚Äôs connect and drive the field of microbiomics forward together!

## üõ† Projects

#### 1. Application of LLM in Microbiome Taxonomy
Claude's innovative approach using the entire NCBI database with the LLM offers direct taxonomic insights from FASTQ sequences. A potential game-changer when compared with traditional methods.

#### 2. Performance of Microbiome DA Methods in Other Omics
Exploring how microbiome DA methods, known for processing the compositional nature of microbiome data, perform on other omics.

#### 3. Generative AI in Microbiome Data Analysis and Accuracy Assessment
Assessing the LLM model's capability as a microbiome data analysis expert against real-world experts.

#### 4. PI_find
A tool designed to assist graduate school aspirants in discovering PI names from specific professional journals.

#### 5. Fine-Tuning Platform for Bioinformatics Repositories
Aiming to develop a platform to fine-tune ChatGPT with bioinformatics repositories, enhancing query results for newer tools.
