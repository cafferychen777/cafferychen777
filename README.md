üìä Statistics PhD Student | üß¨ Multi-Omics Analyst | üñ• R Package Developer

## Hello! I'm Caffery Yangüëã

I am thrilled to be joining the Statistics PhD program at Texas A&M University in Fall 2024. As a recent graduate from Southern Medical University, where I majored in Biostatistics and achieved a 3.95/4.00 GPA (top 2% of my class), I am currently visiting Jian Yang's Lab at Westlake University to further enrich my research experience before starting my doctoral studies.

## üéñ Achievements
- Received the [**National Scholarship**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yry7uzQGdY1d56VRJJo3cqil1jeTWXL6BipN1oNld-Y/edit) from the Ministry of Education of China.
- Secured **First Prize** in the National College Student Mathematics Competition.
- Honored with **Meritorious Winner (M Award)** in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) in the USA.

## üß™ Research Interests
Under the guidance of [**Prof. Jun Chen**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gonDvdwAAAAJ&hl=en) at Mayo Clinic and [**Prof. Liangliang Zhang**](https://sites.google.com/view/lyonszhang/home?authuser=0) at Case Western Reserve University, my research primarily revolves around microbiome data analysis.

- Developed the [**MicrobiomeStat R package**](https://github.com/cafferychen777/MicrobiomeStat), writing **over 17,000 lines of R code**. Comprehensive documentation is available on the [**package wiki**](https://www.microbiomestat.wiki/), which contains in-depth guidance and tutorials exceeding **20,000 words**. Additionally, an interactive [**MicrobiomeStat Shiny application**](https://microbiomestat.shinyapps.io/MicrobiomeStat-Shiny/) has been created to provide a user-friendly platform for longitudinal statistical analysis and visualization of microbiome data.
- Pioneered the [**MicrobiomeGallery**](https://a95dps-caffery-chen.shinyapps.io/MicrobiomeGallery/) collaborative platform.
- Independently developed the [**ggpicrust2**](https://github.com/cafferychen777/ggpicrust2) R package, which amassed **85 stars** on GitHub and **over 11,000 downloads** on CRAN.

My future vision embraces a **multi-omics perspective**, synthesizing insights from **genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics**, and more.

## üìö Publications
- Sole first author on a paper accepted by **Bioinformatics**.
- Preparing to submit another paper as sole first author to **Microbiome**.

## ü§ù Collaboration
I am **extremely open to collaborations**. If you have any projects related to microbiomics or multi-omics and think we could work together, please don't hesitate to reach out. In addition to being open to new projects, I am particularly enthusiastic about assisting others with their microbiome/multi-omics data analysis. I'm also keen on collaborating with researchers and authors who have utilized my pipelines, such as **ggpicrust2** or **MicrobiomeStat**, in their work. If you are considering or have already used these tools in your paper, I would be thrilled to explore the possibility of co-authorship. Whether it's contributing to data analysis, interpretation, or manuscript preparation, I am ready to bring my expertise to your research. Let's connect and see how we can advance the field of microbiomics together!

## üõ† Projects

#### 1. Application of LLM in Microbiome Taxonomy
Claude's innovative approach using the entire NCBI database with the LLM offers direct taxonomic insights from FASTQ sequences. A potential game-changer when compared with traditional methods.

#### 2. Performance of Microbiome DA Methods in Other Omics
Exploring how microbiome DA methods, known for processing the compositional nature of microbiome data, perform on other omics.

#### 3. Generative AI in Microbiome Data Analysis and Accuracy Assessment
Assessing the LLM model's capability as a microbiome data analysis expert against real-world experts.

#### 4. PI_find
A tool designed to assist graduate school aspirants in discovering PI names from specific professional journals.

#### 5. Fine-Tuning Platform for Bioinformatics Repositories
Aiming to develop a platform to fine-tune ChatGPT with bioinformatics repositories, enhancing query results for newer tools.
